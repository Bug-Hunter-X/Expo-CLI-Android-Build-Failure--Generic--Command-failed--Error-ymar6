Troubleshooting steps to resolve the generic 'Command failed' error during Expo Android builds:

1. **Check Android SDK and Build Tools:** Ensure you have the necessary Android SDK components and build tools installed. Use the Android SDK Manager to verify and update if needed.
2. **Gradle Configuration:** Carefully examine your `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files for any syntax errors, inconsistencies, or outdated configurations. 
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's build cache. Run `./gradlew clean` within the `android` directory before attempting to rebuild. 
4. **Dependency Issues:** Check for conflicts or missing dependencies in your `package.json`. Make sure all required packages are installed and compatible.
5. **Detailed Logs:** Look for additional clues in the build logs. The general 'Command failed' message often hides more detailed error messages within the complete log output. Try increasing the verbosity of your build commands if possible.
6. **Emulator/Device Issues:**  If you are building for an emulator, try cleaning your emulator's data. If using a physical device, ensure proper USB connection and driver installation.
7. **Proxy Settings:** If you're behind a corporate proxy, make sure your Gradle build system is properly configured to access internet resources.
8. **Consult Expo Documentation:**  Check Expo's official documentation for any known issues or troubleshooting guides related to Android builds. 
9. **Community Support:** Search online forums (such as Stack Overflow) for similar issues, or ask for help in the Expo community forums.
