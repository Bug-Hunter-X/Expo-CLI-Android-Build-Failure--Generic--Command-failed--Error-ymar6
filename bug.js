This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message is usually quite generic and unhelpful. It doesn't provide any specific details about the cause of the failure. The build process simply stops with a non-zero exit code. 

```bash
Failed to build Android APK. 
Error: Command failed: ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

This error can be caused by a variety of issues, including problems with the Android SDK, Gradle configuration, dependencies, or even simple typos in your project files. The lack of a detailed error message makes it difficult to pinpoint the cause.
