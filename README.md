# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Generic 'Command failed' Error

This repository demonstrates a common but frustrating issue encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI.  The build process abruptly fails with a generic 'Command failed' message, offering little to no information about the underlying cause. This makes debugging extremely challenging.

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified Expo project structure to reproduce the error (although the exact cause may vary).  The `bugSolution.js` file provides potential solutions and troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue. 

This issue is particularly problematic because the lack of detailed error messages forces developers to resort to trial-and-error debugging, which can be incredibly time-consuming.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions (if any) to install necessary dependencies.
3. Attempt to build the Android APK using `expo build:android`.
4. Observe the generic 'Command failed' error.

## Solutions

The `bugSolution.js` file offers various troubleshooting steps to address the issue. These include checking Android SDK versions, Gradle configuration, and dependency resolutions.
